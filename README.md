# BattleStarWars

It is a game developed with Java Processing 3. I have developed a shooting arcade game where user has to defeat the enemies by shooting them. My game is inspired from a movie series. Star Wars.The protagonist in my game is Luke Skywalker who is controlled by the user. As for the enemies I have included Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. The user has to shoot down the enemies to go through the game. The user gets a chance to decide difficulty of the game. I have been a big fan of shooting games. It can be noticed that I have used a car background for my game, my unparallel love for cars inspired me to use that. I have also used music to hype people up.
Including some of my favourite characters in a shooting game is a dream come true for me. Initially my thought was to do a light saber fight but that wouldnâ€™t 
give much time for user to move around to kill other enemies so I decided to let Luke Skywalker shoot them.
